<h3>Implementation</h3>
<hr>
<p>
This is the implementation of second tier which is the middleWare and is part of a three tier heterogeneous System which communicates between the application tier and data tier.
This tier was built using Maven build tool and uses Spring Framework plugins to implement a REST API that uses HTTP to communicate between tiers.
The design could have been much improved but because of a few constraints on the other tiers and the curriculum it is such.

<p>
The latest updates and restructuring of code is on development branch
